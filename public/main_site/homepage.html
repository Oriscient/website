      <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hi and welcome to my little corner of the internet. You can call me Oris, Oriscient, whatever. This is a new name, I am not very attached to it yet.</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm in my 20s and I've been living on the internet for as long as I remember. And in this time I've seen this palce evolve. As a lot of us using this platform, I started to feel disconnected from the world wide web, and as it was getting larger and larger, it felt more and more alienating. The monopoly that the tech industry and the big social media platform now has on the internet finally made me break, and the need to create this place appeared. I wanted to have a place where things felt intentional, smaller, handmade. Maybe it will also be a place for me where community gets built. Who knows. In any way welcome to my Garden of Everything.</p>

      <h2>Garden of Everything</h2>
        <p>I've always jumped from interest to interest, usually juggling multiple at the same time. From media to creative outlets to hobbies I've always live this way. And so, as I was wasting away my time on the internet in a way that sucked my creativity, not feeling inspired by the soulless state of the global internet, I decided to create this garden, and hopefully it will help me in tending to my various interests a bit more closely. To really recapture the joy of a kid drawing, trying graphic design and posting ugly banners and signatures on forums with an innocent confidence.</p>
